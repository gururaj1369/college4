			<br>
			<p>Second Shift Diploma Courses in DME,DECE and DCME are started in the year of 2009 with intake of 60 in each course.Additional courses are upgraded in DEEE and DCE in the year of 2013 with intake 60 in each.Second shift diploma courses are running with well established laboratories and experienced faculty.</p>
			<b>DCME - Diploma in Computer Engineering</b>
			<p>Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of engineering and computer science required to develop computer systems. Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering, software design, and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. DCME includes subjects like Computer Fundamentals, Basic Electrical &amp; Electronics Engg, Digital Electronics &amp; Computer Architecture, RDBMS, Microprocessors, Languagues including C++, JAVA, .NET etc, Web Designing, Computer Hardware, Networking, System Adminstration and etc.</p>
			
			<b>DECE - Diploma in Electronics &amp; Communications Engineering</b>
			<p>Electronics &amp; Communications Engineering is an engineering discipline where non-linear and active electrical components such as electron tubes, and semiconductor devices, especially transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, are utilized to design electronic circuits, devices and systems, typically based on printed circuit boards. The term denotes a broad engineering field that covers important sujects such as Basic Electronics, Electronic Circuits, Communications Engineering, Communications Systems, Analog Electronics, Digital Electronics, Consumer Electronics,Telecommunications, Microprocessors, Microcontrollers, Embedded Systems and Power Electronics.</p>
		<b>DME - Diploma in Mechnical Engineering</b>	
		<p>Mechanical engineering is a discipline of engineering that applies the principles of physics and materials science for analysis, design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. It is the branch of engineering that involves the production and usage of heat and mechanical power for the design, production, and operation of machines and tools. It is one of the oldest and broadest engineering disciplines. DME includes subjects like Workshop Technology, Thermal Engineering, Manufacturing Technology, Machine Drawing, CAD, Strength of Materials, Production Drawing, Hydraulics, Refrigeration &amp; Air Conditioning, Automobile Engineering, Servicing &amp; Maintenence and more.</p>
		
		<b>DEEE - Diploma in Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering</b>
		<p>Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering is a field of engineering that deals with the technology of electricity, especially the design and application of circuitry and equipment for power generation and distribution, machine control, and communications. DEEE inculdes subjects like Basic Electrical Engineering, Electrical Circuits, DC Machines &amp; Batteries, Measuring Instruments, Electrinics Engg, AC Machines, Power Systems, Electrical Installations, Electrical Engg Drawing, Microcontrollers, Digital Electronics, Power Electronics, Electrical CAD, Energy Sources and more.</p>
			
			<b>DCE - Diploma in Civil Engineering</b>
			<p>Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works like bridges, roads, canals, dams, and buildings. Civil engineering takes place on all levels: in the public sector from municipal through to national governments, and in the private sector from individual homeowners through to international companies. DCE includes subjects like Surveying, Engineering Mechanics, Hydraulics, Strength of Materials, Construction Materials, Irrigation Engineering, RC Structures, Construction Practice, CAD, Steel Structures,Transportation Engineering and etc.</p>
